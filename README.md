GoLife: Experience the mesmerizing simplicity of Conway's Game of Life brought to life in Go. Harnessing the power of functional programming, this implementation offers a visually captivating journey into the realm of cellular automata, where patterns emerge and evolve with each iteration.

> **Note :** I want to emphasise that I am very new to Go and thus some patterns might be a bit confusing. However, feel free to come up with suggestions of how to make it better, I'd be more than happy to see it evolve!

### Run the code

Run GOL with a **randomised** seed.

```sh
go run .
```

@ TODO: Add more instructions on how to run the code.

Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
